# Mileage Prediction - Reegression Analysis

The mileage prediction model uses regression analysis to predict the fuel efficiency (mileage) of a vehicle based on various input features.

How it Works

1. Data Collection: Gather dataset containing input features (e.g., engine size, number of cylinders, transmission type) and target variable (mileage).
2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
3. Feature Engineering: Transform input features into suitable formats.
4. Model Selection: Choose regression technique(s) based on data characteristics.
5. Model Training: Train model using training dataset.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using evaluation metrics (e.g., R-squared, MAE, RMSE).
7. Model Tuning: Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

Prediction Process

1. Input Features: Provide input features for a new, unseen vehicle (e.g., engine size, number of cylinders, transmission type).
2. Model Prediction: Use trained model to predict mileage based on input features.
3. Output: Receive predicted mileage value.
